A Final Group Project completed in course W261 "Machine Learning at Scale" at UC Berkeley's MIDS program.

The goal was to predict flight delays using classificaiton (0 not delayed and 1 delayed) and regression (by how many minutes is a flight delayed).

The code was done via python's spark library pyspark and was run on via Databricks on Jupyter Notebooks.
